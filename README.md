# Presidential candidate speech project

Purpose
Create a collection of csv files containing all the words used in campaign speeches by each candidate for the 2016 elections. Presidental candidates say a lot of things. Taking words out of context can sometimes seem like the main purpose of the internet. This is a personal project that shows the words most used by some candidates.

Using python and the fantastic beautiful soup library, I have grabbed some of the freely available transcripts of these candidates and distilled the information into a csv of word and frequency.

Using the javascript library d3.js, I have created a simple word cloud of the most commonly used words.

 Modules and Libraries used:
 - BeautifulSoup
 - urllib
 - nltk
 - pandas
 - string
 - nltk
 
 

Only speeches and interviews made since the respective announcements of their candidacy will be considered.
The full list of speeches follow.
